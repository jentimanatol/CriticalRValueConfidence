## 🧠 What is it?

**Critical r-value Calculator & Visualizer by AJ** is an intuitive, GUI-based application crafted for **students**, **educators**, **data analysts**, and **researchers** who work with **Pearson's r**.

It helps you easily compute and visualize the **critical r-value** — the correlation cutoff point for statistical significance — based on any chosen **α level** (significance) and **sample size (n)**.

> ✨ **No programming. Just input values, hit calculate, and get insights visually!**

## 🧰 Who is this for?

This app is especially useful for:

* 📚 **Students** learning statistics and correlation analysis
* 🧪 **Researchers** verifying their r-values
* 👩‍🏫 **Instructors** needing a quick teaching tool
* 📈 **Data analysts** working with sample-based correlation studies

Whenever you use **Pearson correlation**, knowing the **critical r-value** helps you decide whether your correlation is **statistically significant**. This tool reveals how that threshold shifts with different **sample sizes** or **α levels** — all in a visual, user-friendly way.

## 🛠️ How to Use It

1. **Enter Significance Level (α)**
   Example: `0.05` (95% confidence level)

2. **Enter Sample Size (n)**
   Minimum: `3` (e.g., `14`)

3. **Click “Calculate & Plot”**
   You’ll get:

   * ± Critical r-value
   * Degrees of freedom (df)
   * t-critical value
   * Formula & explanation
   * A dynamic r-value vs. n plot

4. **Click “💾 Save Plot”**
   Save your chart as a `.png` for use in presentations, papers, or reports.

## 🔍 Formula Reference

```txt
Degrees of Freedom: df = n - 2
t-critical:        From the two-tailed t-distribution at α
r-critical:        r = t / √(t² + df)
```
